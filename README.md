Social media has changed the way we communicate with each other. The power behind social media allows us to do amazing things together. What exactly is behind it? Well.. it's Simple Web Application concepts that can be applied to ALL and ANY web applications that you may build.

In this course we're going to teach you what's behind how Twitter works. Now, Twitter has hundreds of developers so what we're actually building is the basis of what Twitter once was, the absolute most simple things by learning more Django along the way. 

What are we going to learn:

Ajax + jQuery to "Tweet" messages

Tag users directly (@user)

Use Hashtags (#newtag)

Integrate Bootstrap

Using an Ajax form within a Bootstrap Modal

Django Rest Framework

Follow users (via Ajax)

Like posts (via Ajax)

Retweet posts (via Ajax)

Class Based Views

Custom Template Tags

And much more!

We do everything step-by-step so even if you're an absolute beginner, you can follow along. Cheers!
